In search of the Black Water<br>

Prologue...
</center>
[*young male voice:*]<br>
Arrays of sun-melted clouds travel smoothly along the horizon. Red and white smoke surrounding the contours of a flying flagship. Soon nightfall will
have devoured the Zeppelin completely, as well as the industry towers, the prosperity-lake and the pearl skyscrapers. It's all quiet on the western earth –

[*old female voice:*]<br>
at least the huge screens on the gothic churches and in the highly frequented streets tell us this story.

[*young female voice:*]<br>
The Communist dream is over –

[*middle-aged male voice:*]<br>
the American dream shattered for the masses.

[*young male voice:*]<br>
a generation examining the fates of the Timelines:

[*Gideon*]<br>
Some search for black waters,<br>
some for release,<br>
some just want to live the moment,<br>
and some long for federalistic peace ---

[*young girl voice:*]<br>
Some don't care at all but that again is not a question of prosperity but a question of definition.

[*old male voice:*] <br>
One can understand hell only if (s)he doesn't live in it.

[*old female voice:*]<br>
Living in it there's no need to understand.

[*middle aged male voice:*]<br>
You just want to get out and break free.

[*young boy voice:*]<br>
In any case there's no doubt about imperialistic entanglements – the wealth that was built on the sublime oppression is still ruling our path.

[*young female voice*]<br>
But: To be honest... our guilt cannot be found in reaction but in delusion of our doings.

[*Gideon*]<br>
Some still remember a paradisecall.
